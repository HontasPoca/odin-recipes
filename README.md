The project is about getting a more firm and solid base, which is destined to seal the basics and the beginners level of programming a website. Rly sh*tty website.
The website is intended on being a recipes website that will direct the user to various delicous and colorful foods and how to cook them. With ease, of course. 
The denominated foods are my favorites, so no reviews or criticism are gonna get any sort of stage or attention.
Enjoy your time on my humble site, and start developing the hunger of the hour (as for me, i eat about every second-hour, so....)
