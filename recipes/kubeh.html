        <h1>Kub'eh - Soup with pastry balls filled with meat</h1>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>One of the best dishes and a favorite by me and many many Israelis. 
            The dish's variety of greens, middle eastern spices and meat keep the 
            dish in a moderate level of health prioritization, while also giving you a 
            taste that sends you to the essence of what many Israelis conceptualize of 
            being Israeli.
